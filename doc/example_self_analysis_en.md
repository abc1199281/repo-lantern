# Example: Lantern Analyzes Itself

Here is a summary of the architecture report generated by Lantern analyzing its own codebase (`lantern-cli`):

### [Generated] Project Overview

**Lantern CLI** is a Python-based command-line tool designed to help developers rapidly understand unfamiliar codebases.

#### Core Architecture
The system uses a **Pipeline Pattern**, consisting of the following primary modules:

1.  **CLI Layer (`src/lantern_cli/cli`)**
    -   Uses the `Typer` framework to handle command-line inputs (`main.py`).
    -   Orchestrates the execution flow of `init`, `plan`, and `run` commands.

2.  **Core Layer (`src/lantern_cli/core`)**
    -   **Architect (`architect.py`)**: Acts as the planner, analyzing the `DependencyGraph` and generating a batched analysis plan (`lantern_plan.md`).
    -   **Runner (`runner.py`)**: Acts as the executor, communicating with LLM backends, executing batch analysis, and handling state persistence (`StateManager`) for resume capability.
    -   **Synthesizer (`synthesizer.py`)**: Acts as the synthesizer, aggregating scattered batch analysis results (`.sense` files) into final Top-down documentation.

3.  **Backend Adapter Layer (`src/lantern_cli/backends`)**
    -   Implements the Strategy Pattern via `BackendFactory`.
    -   Supports multiple LLM backends: `CodexAdapter`, `GeminiAdapter`, `ClaudeAdapter`.
    -   Abstracts away the invocation details of different CLI tools.
